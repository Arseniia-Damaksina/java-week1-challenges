        // Why can you just print all of these?
        // Java automatically converts them into strings using 'System.out.println'.
        // This is called 'autoboxing' or implicit conversion to String;

        // Why are those called primitive data types?
        // They are called 'primitive' because they are the most basic data types built into the Java.
        // They are not objects and store simple values directly in memory;

        // Why can't you assign a double to an integer?
        // You can't assign a double to an int because it's a narrowing conversion (loses precision).
        // Java prevents it unless you explicitly cast it;

        // But why can you assign an integer to a char?
        // You can assign an integer to a char if it's within the char range (0â€“65535).
        // Java will interpret it as the Unicode character with that code;

        // Why can't you assign a long to an int?
        // long big = 10000000000L;
        // int small = (int) big; // You can force it, but it overflows
        // You can't assign a long to an int because it might not fit.
        // A long can hold bigger numbers than an int. You need to cast, but it can cause overflow or data loss;
